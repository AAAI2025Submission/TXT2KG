introduce: In my country, termination of pregnancy before 28 weeks and when the fetus weighs less than 1,000 grams is called miscarriage.According to the different periods of occurrence, it can be divided into:Early miscarriage: occurs before 12 weeks of pregnancy.Late miscarriage: occurs after 12 weeks of pregnancy.According to the different causes of occurrence, it can be divided into:Spontaneous miscarriage: the embryo or fetus develops in the uterus for too short a time to continue the pregnancy.Artificial abortion: artificial methods are required to terminate the pregnancy due to unexpected pregnancy or illness.Usually, about 3/10 will have spontaneous miscarriage after embryo implantation, and the vast majority (about 80%) are early miscarriages. Among early miscarriages, most are hidden miscarriages, that is, miscarriages that occur before the menstrual period.The main symptoms are vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain.
Causes: Basic causesThe main causes of spontaneous abortion include embryonic factors, maternal factors, and environmental factors, as follows:Embryonic factors: Embryonic chromosomal abnormalities are the most common in early abortions, accounting for about 50% to 60%; about 1/3 in mid-term abortions; and only 5% in late abortions. In addition to genetic factors that can cause chromosomal abnormalities, infections and the use of certain drugs by pregnant women may also cause embryonic chromosomal abnormalities.Maternal factorsAccompanied by systemic diseases, or endocrine and cardiovascular diseases.Infection with pathogens, such as Toxoplasma, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, etc. Although the damage to the pregnant woman herself is not great, it is likely to cause abortion.Malformation or dysfunction of reproductive system organs, mainly accompanied by various types of uterine lesions.Immune dysfunction, for example, the immune system of autoimmune disease patients can produce antibodies to attack their own tissues and organs, or in some cases, the mother can produce antibodies to attack the fetus.Suffering from severe physical and mental trauma or stimulation.Harm to pregnant women or fetuses caused by bad living habits.Environmental factorsLong-term and excessive exposure to radiation.Living or working in an environment with high concentrations of pollutants.Risk factorsAge: The older you are, the higher the risk of miscarriage.Pregnancy: As the number of pregnancies increases, the uterine function declines.History of repeated spontaneous abortions.Multiple artificial abortions in the past.Overwork during pregnancy, excessive mental stress, or drastic mood swings.Heavy smoking, alcoholism, drinking a lot of coffee or other caffeinated beverages, and taking drugs.The presence of toxic and harmful substances or strong radiation in the workplace.Accompanied by various chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and liver and kidney dysfunction.
Symptoms: The main clinical features of spontaneous abortion include vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. In early abortion, vaginal bleeding usually occurs first, followed by pain. In late abortion, abdominal pain occurs first, followed by vaginal bleeding.Typical symptomsEarly abortion (before 12 weeks): The embryo usually dies before the pregnancy is discharged, vaginal bleeding occurs first, followed by the discharge of the embryo and its appendages, and paroxysmal abdominal pain occurs. After the embryo-related substances are completely emptied, the uterus contracts and the bleeding stops.Late abortion (12 weeks to 28 weeks): Paroxysmal abdominal pain occurs first, followed by vaginal bleeding. There are often signs of life when the embryo is discharged, mostly due to abnormal uterine structure. The whole process is similar to premature delivery, and the fetus and placenta will eventually be delivered.Development process: Spontaneous abortion can be divided into the following clinical types according to different development stages.Threatened abortion: A small amount of vaginal bleeding occurs before 28 weeks of pregnancy, no pregnancy is discharged, followed by paroxysmal abdominal pain or back pain. After rest and timely treatment, the symptoms can disappear and the pregnancy can continue. If vaginal bleeding increases or paroxysmal abdominal pain intensifies, it may develop into inevitable miscarriage.Inevitable miscarriage: At this stage, miscarriage is inevitable. On the basis of threatened miscarriage, vaginal bleeding continues to increase, abdominal pain intensifies, and fetal membranes may rupture, with fluid flowing out of the vagina. Sometimes there will be embryonic tissue or fetal sac blocking the cervical opening.Incomplete miscarriage: On the basis of inevitable miscarriage, part of the pregnancy product is discharged from the uterus, but some of it remains in the uterine cavity or cervical opening, affecting uterine contraction, which can cause heavy bleeding and even shock.Complete miscarriage: The pregnancy product is completely discharged, vaginal bleeding gradually stops, and abdominal pain disappears.
How to prevent it: Abortion is a natural phenomenon. The causes of abortion are very complex. Some congenital factors are difficult to prevent. The following methods may help reduce the risk of spontaneous abortion:Actively treat the underlying disease and ensure the overall health during pregnancy as much as possible.Protective measures should be taken during the high-incidence season of infectious diseases to avoid pathogen infection.After learning of pregnancy, you should adjust your life and work rhythm in time to avoid excessive fatigue and mental stress.Improve your lifestyle, exercise moderately, eat healthily, quit smoking and drinking.If there are toxic and harmful substances or high-intensity radiation in the workplace, you should adjust your job position to avoid damage to the fetus.
examine: The disease is mainly diagnosed by medical history, symptoms and signs, gynecological examination, laboratory examination and imaging examination. The specific examination methods are as follows:Gynecological examination: clarify the progression stage of miscarriage as a basis for formulating clinical response measures.Laboratory examinationPregnancy test: determine whether pregnancy is present. Continuously measure the level of human chorionic gonadotropin in the blood to predict the outcome of pregnancy.Hormone measurement: measuring the level of progesterone in the blood helps to determine the outcome of pregnancy.Pathogen examination: determine whether there is a related infection that induces miscarriage.B-ultrasoundFor those suspected of threatened miscarriage, determine whether the embryo is still alive and formulate a treatment plan.Incomplete miscarriage can be confirmed with the help of B-ultrasound.Others: Those with recurrent miscarriage may also need to undergo genetic examinations, autoimmune disease examinations, endocrine disease examinations, uterine morphology and function examinations, etc., in order to find out the cause of recurrent miscarriage.
treatment: The main treatment methods include pregnancy preservation and termination of pregnancy. The corresponding treatment plan should be formulated according to the specific stage and type of miscarriage of the pregnant woman.Pregnancy preservation treatmentPregnancy preservation refers to the use of medical measures to prevent miscarriage by ensuring the healthy development of the embryo after threatened miscarriage. Different methods are generally adopted for different causes:If the miscarriage is caused by fatigue or trauma, bed rest and sexual intercourse are prohibited.If there is a problem with the corpus luteum function, such as surgical removal of the corpus luteum for some reason in early pregnancy, or a decrease in progesterone levels due to surgical operations during assisted reproduction (IVF, etc.), progesterone treatment can be applied.If the patient has hypothyroidism, thyroxine can be supplemented.If the patient has a loose cervical os, cervical cerclage, bed rest, and uterine contraction inhibitor treatment can be used.Termination of pregnancyIndications: After 2 weeks of pregnancy preservation treatment, symptoms continue to worsen, B-ultrasound and other examinations show that the embryo is poorly developed, and hCG test continues to not rise or even decreases, indicating that miscarriage cannot be avoided.Methods: medical abortion or surgical abortion (curettage).
Nutrition and Diet: Pay attention to healthy diet, control the intake of salt, sugar, and lipids, and avoid consuming large amounts of fat and sugar.Eat enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and dairy products every day, and ensure adequate drinking of water.Take medication under the guidance of a doctor, supplement with appropriate amounts of vitamin supplements, and do not take nutritional and health products at will.
Precautions: During the period of pregnancy preservationYou should take a proper rest and avoid fatigueAvoid sexual intercourseAvoid any external stimulationDuring the "small confinement" period after the failure of pregnancy preservationPay attention to personal hygiene, you can brush your teeth, wash your hair and take a bath normally.Late-term abortion may cause lactation, try to drink less soup, and if necessary, you need to stop breastfeeding.Keep the reproductive tract clean, do not take a bath in a tub, you should take a shower, and avoid sexual intercourse.Observe the vaginal bleeding. If the bleeding continues for more than a week, or there is lower abdominal pain, fever, and increased secretions, you should have a review in time.Pay attention to rest and avoid heavy physical activities, but do not lie in bed all the time, and do appropriate exercise.Family members should pay attention to the mood swings of the mother and cooperate to comfort her emotions.Pregnancy again: It is not advisable to get pregnant immediately after abortion. It is generally recommended to conceive at least 2 menstrual cycles or 3 months later.Common questionsQ: How long after abortion can I have a child again?A: Pregnancy again after abortion, that is, the time interval between pregnancy and re-pregnancy should be at least more than 6 months. Most women can consider pregnancy again 6 to 12 months after abortion.During pregnancy, the uterus is affected by sex hormones and becomes progressively larger. However, after a miscarriage, the secretion of sex hormones in the female body decreases, and the uterus slowly returns to a non-pregnant state. This is called uterine involution, and it takes about 2 months. For the sake of pregnancy safety, it is not recommended to get pregnant immediately after uterine involution. It is recommended to wait at least 6 months, which can be extended to 12 months to improve the safety of pregnancy and pregnancy again.

Prognosis: The prognosis of threatened abortion mainly depends on whether the embryonic development is abnormal, and secondly whether the various factors that cause abortion can be controlled in time.For embryonic chromosomal abnormalities and embryonic malformations, abortion is a natural elimination and selection process; for abortion caused by non-embryo reasons, such as corpus luteum insufficiency, uterine malformation and cervical insufficiency, if they can be corrected, the prognosis is good.Most women can become pregnant and give birth normally again after abortion. Less than 5% of women can have two consecutive abortions, and only 1% of women have three consecutive abortions.
