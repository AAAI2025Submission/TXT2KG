introduce: Labor force is the driving force of childbirth, which is the force that pushes the fetus out of the uterus. Among them, uterine contraction force is the main driving force, which runs through the entire process of childbirth. Abnormal labor force refers to abnormal uterine contraction force, that is, uterine contraction loses rhythm and symmetry, or the intensity and frequency of contraction are too strong or too weak. The main symptoms are that the mother feels irritable and restless, has persistent pain in the lower abdomen, and the pain worsens after pressing. Among them, uterine contraction atony is more common in primiparas, especially those over 35 years old.
Causes: This disease is caused by abnormal uterine contraction force, and its occurrence is mainly related to the following factors:Uterine atonyUterine factorsMultiple births, macrosomia, polyhydramnios, etc., cause excessive elongation of uterine muscle fibers, thus losing normal contraction ability.Multiple pregnancies and childbirths, curettage, repeated uterine cavity infections, etc., cause the connective tissue inside the uterus to proliferate, form scars, and affect the uterine contraction ability.Uterine hypoplasia, uterine malformation, uterine fibroids, etc. can all affect the normal contraction function of the uterus and lead to uterine atony.Birth canal and fetal factorsAbnormal pelvic size and shape lead to narrow birth canal.The fetus is too large and the fetal position is not correct, resulting in cephalopelvic disproportion (the size and position of the fetal head are not proportional to the size and shape of the maternal pelvis), so that the fetal head cannot pass through the pelvis, hindering its descent.The first fetal part (fetal presenting part) that enters the pelvic entrance cannot be close to and compress the lower uterine segment and uterine cervix, so it cannot stimulate the local nerve plexus well and cause reflex effective uterine contraction.Mental factors: Due to the mental tension, anxiety and fear of the parturient, the central nervous system function is disturbed, thus affecting the uterine contraction.Endocrine disorders and electrolyte abnormalities: After delivery, the secretion of estrogen, oxytocin and other substances in the parturient's body is insufficient, resulting in reduced uterine contraction function. Abnormal electrolyte concentrations (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) can also affect the contraction ability of uterine muscle fibers.Drug influence: In the late pregnancy, especially after delivery, improper use of large doses of sedatives, analgesics, and anesthetics, such as chlorpromazine, morphine, and pethidine, can inhibit uterine contraction and lead to uterine atony.Other factorsParturients with chronic systemic diseases such as malnutrition and anemia are weak and prone to uterine atony.After delivery, the parturient is in a state of fatigue due to insufficient food and sleep and great physical exertion.The parturient's bladder is full and cannot urinate normally, resulting in urinary retention, which hinders the descent of the fetal presenting part.Excessive uterine contractionExcessive contraction of all uterine muscles: usually caused by external factors. If oxytocin is used improperly, it can cause tonic and spasmodic contractions in the myometrium above the internal cervical os.Some uterine muscles contract too strongly: mostly due to excessive fatigue, mental stress, or rough vaginal operations.
Symptoms: This disease can be divided into two categories: uterine atony (weak uterine contractions) and uterine hypercontraction (excessive uterine contractions). Each category can be divided into coordinated and uncoordinated types. The most common one is coordinated uterine atony.Typical symptomsUterine atonyCoordinated uterine atony: uterine contractions <2 times/10 minutes. Due to the low intrauterine pressure, it has little effect on the fetus.Uncoordinated uterine atonyThe mother feels irritable and has persistent pain in the lower abdomen, which worsens after pressing.In severe cases, symptoms such as dehydration (dry mouth, dry skin, and less urine), abdominal distension, and urinary retention (the bladder is full of urine, but it cannot be discharged normally) may occur.The fetus may experience fetal distress, which is manifested by fetal heart sounds above 160 times per minute, or below 120 times per minute.Abnormal labor processProlonged latent period: From the start of regular uterine contractions to the time when the cervix dilates by 3 cm, primiparas are >16 hours and multiparas are >8 hours.Prolonged active period: from the time when the cervix dilates 3 cm to the time when the cervix is ​​fully dilated, the time for primipara is >8 hours.Excessive uterine contractionsCoordinated uterine contractions are too strong: uterine contractions are >5 times/10 minutes, or contractions last for 2 minutes or longer.Uncoordinated uterine contractions are too strong: the parturient is restless, with persistent pain in the lower abdomen, and the pain worsens after pressing. The fetal heartbeat is unclear or sometimes fast and sometimes slow.ComplicationsCommon complications of this disease include:Uterine atonyIt can cause parturients to have symptoms such as intestinal flatulence, dysuria, dehydration, and postpartum hemorrhage.It causes the fetus to be hypoxic in the uterus, which is prone to fetal distress (abnormal fetal heart rate and fetal movement) or intrauterine fetal death.Excessive uterine contractionsIt can cause lacerations of the parturient's cervix, vagina, and perineum. If there is no time to disinfect during delivery, it can lead to puerperal infection (vaginitis, etc.).It is easy to cause fetal distress and neonatal asphyxia and death.
How to prevent it: This disease is mainly caused by abnormal uterine contractions, which can be prevented by the following methods:Do a good job of prenatal examination and pregnancy care.For those with a history of premature delivery (from regular uterine contractions to fetal placental delivery, the total delivery process is ≤3 hours), it is necessary to be hospitalized 1 to 2 weeks in advance to prevent unexpected delivery outside the hospital.After admission, adapt to the delivery environment as soon as possible, keep the environment quiet, clean, comfortable, and as family-like as possible.For parturients who have no enema contraindications, warm soapy water can be used for enema in the early stage of labor to eliminate feces and accumulated gas, and stimulate uterine contractions. Regularly monitor uterine contractions and fetal heart rate. Parturients with a history of premature delivery should not have enema after delivery.When urinating and defecating, it is necessary to check the size of the cervical opening and the descent of the fetal presenting part to prevent delivery in the toilet and cause accidental injuries.
examine: The disease is mainly diagnosed by history interview, physical examination, electrolyte measurement, fetal heart monitoring, uterine electromyography, etc. The specific examination methods are as follows:Electrolyte measurement: Check whether there are abnormalities in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.Fetal heart monitoring: Using ultrasound Doppler fetal heart monitor to monitor fetal heart rate changes is the main means of evaluating the intrauterine condition of the fetus.Uterine electromyography: Measuring the onset, peak time, duration, frequency and intensity of uterine contractions is helpful for the diagnosis of this disease. It can also be used as a diagnostic tool for suspected premature uterine contractions.
treatment: The treatment of abnormal labor should clarify the cause, fully understand the condition of the mother and fetus, and carry out targeted treatment. The treatment methods mainly include drug therapy, surgical treatment and other treatments.Drug therapyOxytocin: It is the most commonly used drug to strengthen uterine contractions.It is suitable for those with coordinated uterine contractions, good fetal heart rate, normal fetal position, and cephalopelvic symmetry.During the use of oxytocin, a dedicated person is required to monitor, measure blood pressure, observe uterine contractions, listen to fetal heart rate every 15 minutes, or use a fetal heart rate electronic monitor for continuous monitoring.Dinoprost: Promotes uterine contraction. When the cervical condition of the parturient is poor, the effect is better than oxytocin. Its adverse reactions include excessive uterine contractions, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, blurred vision, etc.DiazepamIt can calm, relax cervical smooth muscles, soften the cervix, and promote cervical dilation. The effect is better when used in combination with oxytocin.It is suitable for those with slow cervical dilation and cervical edema.Phloroglucinol: relieve cervical spasm and edema, accelerate cervical dilation, and shorten the labor process.Uterine contraction inhibitors: such as magnesium sulfate combined with glucose injection, epinephrine combined with glucose injection. Relieve tonic contractions.Sedatives: such as pethidine and morphine. Sedation to allow the mother to rest fully.Symptomatic treatment: such as glucose combined with vitamin C injection to supplement nutrition, sodium bicarbonate to neutralize acidosis, potassium chloride to supplement potassium, vitamin K1 to prevent neonatal intracranial hemorrhage, etc.Surgical treatmentCesarean section: The surgical indications are as follows.Those with cephalopelvic disproportion and unable to give birth naturally.Those with excessive uterine muscle contraction, incomplete cervical dilation, and high fetal presenting part.Those with fetal distress.Other treatmentsEnema with warm soapy waterIt can promote intestinal peristalsis, accelerate the discharge of feces and gas accumulation, and stimulate uterine contraction.It is suitable for primiparas with cervical dilation less than 4 cm, multiparas (women who have already given birth) with cervical dilation less than 2 cm, unruptured membranes, and no cephalopelvic disproportion.Catheterization: Suitable for those with dysuria. After emptying the bladder, it can widen the birth canal and promote uterine contractions.Artificial rupture of membranesIt is mostly used for those in the active period, without cephalopelvic disproportion, and with the fetal head connected (the lowest point of the fetal skull is close to or reaches the level of the parturient's ischial spine, about 4 cm away from the vaginal opening).After rupture of membranes, the fetal head directly adheres to the lower segment of the uterus or the internal cervical os, reflexively causing uterine contractions and accelerating the progress of labor. At the same time, the amount and properties of amniotic fluid can be observed.
Nutrition and Diet: After being admitted to the hospital for delivery, you can eat more high-calorie, easily digestible foods, such as lean meat, fish, milk, soy products, etc.Daily liquid intake should not be less than 2500 ml.
Precautions: Precautions during childbirthWhen the contractions are too strong, the mother can take deep breaths and massage her back. Do not hold her breath downward to avoid premature delivery.When the mother has contractions, try not to shout.During the interval between contractions, rest in the left side position, ensure adequate sleep, avoid excessive physical exertion, and maintain good physical strength and energy.After delivery, urge the mother to urinate every 2 to 4 hours to avoid the impact of bladder filling on contractions.Precautions after deliveryThe mother should pay attention to the cleanliness of the breasts, perineum, and perineum wounds. Prevent puerperal infection, such as vaginitis.Generally, 42 days after delivery, you can go to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic for a follow-up examination. If you have fever, odorous lochia, long-term irregular vaginal bleeding and other symptoms, you need to see a doctor in time and take relevant treatment.
Rehabilitation exercises: Encourage mothers to get out of bed and move around early, which is conducive to uterine contraction and the discharge of lochia (a mixture of fluid discharged from the vagina after delivery).Generally, mothers who give birth naturally can sit up 6 to 12 hours after delivery, and can walk indoors on the second day after delivery.You can also do postpartum health care exercises, lying flat on the bed, legs together, knees bent, feet flat on the bed, hands lightly placed on the chest, mouth closed, slow deep breath and light exhalation, repeat 10 times, 2 times a day.Mothers who have cesarean section can postpone getting up and moving for 2 to 3 days. Postpartum exercise needs to be gradual. According to your own situation, appropriately increase the amount and amplitude of exercise, exercise in small amounts and multiple times, and the cumulative amount of exercise per day can reach 1 hour.
