introduce: Abnormal delivery refers to the obstruction of the delivery process of the mother, which makes it difficult for the fetus to be delivered through the birth canal. The main feature is slow or prolonged delivery.Common symptoms include premature rupture of membranes, irritability of pregnant women, physical exhaustion, reduced food intake, and sometimes dehydration symptoms such as dry mouth, cleft lips, and loss of skin elasticity.
Causes: The occurrence of this disease is mainly related to the following factors:Abnormal laborWeak uterine contractionUterine myogenic factors: abnormal uterine development, excessive stretching of uterine muscle fibers caused by multiple births or polyhydramnios, advanced age, previous birth or miscarriage history, intrauterine infection, uterine fibroids, etc.Endocrine disorders and electrolyte disorders: insufficient synthesis and secretion of prostaglandins, oxytocin and acetylcholine, electrolyte disorders such as blood sodium, blood potassium, blood calcium, and blood magnesium.Drug factors: large doses of drugs that relieve spasms, sedation and analgesia (such as diazepam, magnesium sulfate, pethidine, etc.).Excessive uterine contraction: The cause is still unclear, and it may be related to factors such as previous childbirth, miscarriage, large doses of oxytocin, mental stress, and multiple intrauterine operations.Abnormal birth canalAbnormal bone birth canal: narrow pelvis of the parturient, or deformed pelvis caused by osteomalacia, malnutrition, scoliosis, fractures, etc.Abnormal soft birth canal: scars, edema, infection, deformity or tumors in the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus and other parts.Abnormal fetusAbnormal fetal position: abnormal fetal head position such as persistent occiput posterior position and transverse position, or abnormal fetal position such as shoulder presentation and breech presentation.Abnormal fetal development: macrosomia, conjoined fetus, anencephaly, or fetus with hydrocephalus, ascites, polycystic kidney, liver and kidney tumors.Reasons for pregnant women themselves: height <1.45m, weight <45kg, obesity, adolescent pregnancy, age >50 years old, placental abnormalities, and parturients who cannot tolerate uterine contraction pain are also prone to dystocia.Risk factorsPoor sleep and rest before delivery, insufficient food intake, vomiting, physical exhaustion, excessive fatigue, etc. can all induce dystocia.Tension, fear, pain, unfamiliarity, anxiety and excessive excitement during delivery can also cause dystocia.
Symptoms: The main manifestation of abnormal delivery is prolonged labor and the fetus cannot be delivered smoothly from the birth canal.Typical symptomsMaternal manifestationsSystemic exhaustion symptoms: Maternal symptoms often have systemic symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, and reduced food intake. In severe cases, dehydration, dysuria, hematuria, intestinal flatulence, acid-base and electrolyte disorders may occur.Obstetric symptomsPremature rupture of membranes is a precursor to dystocia.Abnormal uterine contractions, manifested as weak or too strong and too frequent contractions.Edema of the cervix and vulva or slow or stagnant cervical dilation.Delayed or stagnant descent of the presenting part of the fetus.In severe cases, there is a precursor of uterine rupture, manifested as hematuria and tenderness at fixed points in the lower uterine segment. If not handled in time, uterine rupture is likely to occur.Fetal manifestationsThe fetal head has not entered the pelvis or has stopped descending: Some dystocia fetuses have just entered the pelvic inlet plane after labor or when the maternal cervical dilation is 5cm.Abnormal fetal position: Some dystocia fetuses may have abnormal fetal head position and fetal body posture, such as breech presentation, shoulder presentation, face presentation, etc.Fetal head edema or hematoma: Some dystocia fetuses are squeezed by the birth canal for a long time, which may cause blood vessels under the soft tissue to rupture, thereby causing edema or hematoma in the head.Excessive overlap of fetal skull sutures: Some dystocia fetuses may cause excessive squeezing of the skull and overlapping skull sutures due to prolonged labor and difficult delivery.Fetal distress: Fetal heart rate weakens or even disappears due to hypoxia in the uterus, which endangers the life of the fetus in severe cases.Abnormal labor processProlonged latent period: The latent period refers to the process from the beginning of regular contraction of the uterus to the slow expansion of the cervical opening to 4-6cm. This process will be extended for more than 20 hours for dystocia women with first pregnancy, and more than 14 hours for women who have given birth before.Prolonged or stagnant active period: The active period refers to the cervical opening from 4-6cm to full opening, which is the stage when the cervical opening accelerates to full opening.Active phase extension: The rate of cervical dilation of the parturient is less than 0.5cm/hour.Active phase arrest: When the cervical dilation exceeds 6cm, the cervical dilation of the parturient with normal uterine contractions stops for more than 4 hours, or the cervical dilation of the parturient with weak uterine contractions stops for more than 6 hours.Second stage of labor extension or arrest: The second stage of labor refers to the stage from full cervical dilation to complete delivery of the fetus.Delayed descent of the fetal head: The rate of descent of the fetal head from the birth canal of the first pregnant parturient is less than 1cm/hour, and less than 2cm/hour for the parturient who has given birth before.Arrested descent of the fetal head: The fetal head stays in place for more than 1h after it is presented.Second stage of labor extension: The overall time of the second stage of labor of the first pregnant parturient is extended for more than 3 hours, and for more than 4 hours if epidural anesthesia is received.For the parturient who has given birth before, it is more than 2 hours, and for more than 3 hours if epidural anesthesia is received.ComplicationsMaternal complicationsUterine ruptureSoft birth canal lacerationsPostpartum hemorrhageGenital fistulaPostpartum infectionFetal complicationsCord presentation and cord prolapseFetal distressBrachial plexus palsy
How to prevent it: The following methods may help reduce the risk of dystocia:Appropriate exercise after pregnancy, such as taking a walk after meals, can not only control weight gain and promote the growth and development of the fetus, but also create good conditions for smooth delivery and help restore body shape after delivery.Avoid improper exercise such as climbing, climbing ladders, and lifting weights to avoid injuries.Regular prenatal check-ups and pregnancy care should be performed to detect abnormalities of the fetus and the mother in time.Before delivery, the mother's pelvic width, birth canal conditions, and fetal size and position should be carefully checked to determine whether there are risk factors for dystocia.Diet and nutritional intake should be reasonably controlled during pregnancy to avoid giant fetal growth.Ensure good sleep and sufficient physical strength before delivery, replenish energy in time, keep the mentality and emotions relaxed, and keep urination and defecation unobstructed.Provide psychological counseling for mothers who are overly nervous or fearful before delivery. Before the active stage of labor, allow family members to enter the delivery room to accompany and enhance the confidence of the mother.
examine: This disease is mainly diagnosed by physical examination, observation of uterine contractions, vaginal examination, and ultrasound examination. The specific examination methods are as follows:Vaginal examination: It can understand the degree of cervical dilation, whether the cervix is ​​edematous, whether the fetal membrane is ruptured, the degree of fetal head descent, and the determination of fetal position. It is of decisive significance in the diagnosis and treatment of dystocia.Ultrasound examination: It can estimate the weight of the fetus, understand the fetal position, and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of dystocia when the vaginal examination is unclear.Fetal heart rate monitoring: Using the principle of ultrasound, monitor the value, variability and responsiveness of the fetal heart rate, whether there is deceleration and the type of deceleration, and understand the safety of the fetus in the uterus.Maternal vital signs monitoring: Regularly measure and record the blood pressure, body temperature, pulse and respiratory rate of the parturient to understand the physical condition of the parturient and deal with it in time.
treatment: The treatment of abnormal delivery mainly includes general treatment and obstetric treatment.General treatmentComfortable delivery environment and positionThe delivery room should be arranged in a relaxed and quiet manner, with music, TV and related books.Pregnant women can walk and talk in the delivery room at will.A comfortable position should also be adopted during delivery.Some domestic hospitals have launched husbands accompanying delivery, which is also conducive to delivery.Pay attention to the supply of water and nutrition: during the delivery process, the mother is encouraged to drink water and eat, especially for pregnant women with gestational diabetes. If necessary, glucose can be infused to provide corresponding energy.Labor analgesiaBecause pain causes pregnant women to be nervous and anxious, affecting the delivery process, the treatment of labor pain is also an important auxiliary means for dealing with dystocia.The commonly used method at present is epidural anesthesia (injecting local anesthetics into the epidural space to block the spinal nerve roots and temporarily paralyze their innervated areas).Obstetric treatmentCesarean sectionIt is suitable for severe pelvic abnormalities, such as skewed pelvis, or obvious head-pelvic disproportion, or severe fetal malformations.During the trial birth, if there is severe abnormal fetal position, stagnant labor, failure to fully dilate the cervix, inability of the fetal head to descend smoothly, and weak uterine contractions, and there is no significant improvement after active treatment, cesarean section can be considered to terminate the pregnancy.Vaginal deliveryFor primiparas, unless there are no indications for selective cesarean section as mentioned above, they should be given ample opportunities for trial birth.During the trial birth, the labor process should be closely observed, and the four factors that affect labor (labor force, birth canal, fetus, and psychological factors of pregnant women) should be fully evaluated and treated to promote natural labor.
Nutrition and Diet: Increase the intake of high-quality proteins such as fish, eggs, lean meat, milk and beans after childbirth, but not in excess.Eat animal liver at least 1-2 times a week, and eat marine fish, kelp and other seafood once a week.Use iodized salt for cooking.Eat 500g of vegetables every day, and eat more fresh fruits to supplement various vitamins.Drink more water, and try to have soup with every meal.Smoking and drinking are strictly prohibited during the "confinement period", beware of second-hand smoke, and do not drink strong tea and coffee.
Precautions: Get enough sleep and replenish nutrition in time.Mothers who have undergone cesarean section should avoid strenuous activities in the first few weeks after delivery.Keep the wound clean to prevent infection.Try to get out of bed and walk properly after 24 hours to prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis.It is strictly forbidden to take medicine on your own after delivery. You should strictly follow the doctor's advice. Some medicines are prohibited for breastfeeding women.Avoid sexual intercourse within 3 months after cesarean section; if you want to give birth again, you should consider it after 2 years.
